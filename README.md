I took inspiration from 'Code Commerce' and built React JS application based around cryptocurrencies following his tutorial. I changed some visual side and learn about React App. This is my second project using the API, so the process of learning these mechanisms is moving forward.

About the project

This simple app retrieves cryptocurrency information from the Coin Gecko API and displays it on the homepage. We can see the rank, name, 24h price, quantity and market capitalization. After clicking on the selected cryptocurrency, it takes us to a separate page where we can find more information about the pair we are interested in. Percentage changes from 1 hour to 30 days, 24h low and high, circulating supply and read information. CryptoMarket allows you to return to the main page.
